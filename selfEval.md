# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?
    - It is an area I'm working on. I get too wrapped in perfecting an assignment or diving into the material too deep and miss my calendar deadlines or turn in assignments at the last moment or late. Not sure how I could be supported in this without someone standing over me forcing me to follow my calendar. 
- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is?
    - A function is something that tells a computer to follow a set of directions. It stores those directions so they don't need to be repeated later and the computer will just do it. Like making your bed. The first time we made your bed, I had to show you each step on how to make your bed, fixing the sheet, fluffing the pillow, pulling the comforter straight, etc. Now I can just say "Hey 5-year-old, go make your bed! And you know exactly what to do.
- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters.
    - Parameters are the placeholders listed in the definition of a function. They tell a function how many pieces of data to expect and in what order to expect it. You can also name them with helpful identifiers to ease in writing the function statements.
    - Arguments are the actual data being put into the function. The data type and quantity must match the function parameters but otherwise the arguments can be anything and will be what the function actually processes.
- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to bring to your Small Group?
